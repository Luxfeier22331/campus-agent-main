# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** 先把新的 supervisor-led multi-agent 架构站稳，并用 runtime-profile-driven serving surface 证明这条架构能可靠承接高频校园问答
**Current focus:** Phase 7 handbook verification 已完成；当前 follow-up 重点是按新 runbook 补齐 `curriculum_plan` query-serving 的 fresh live gate，并在已落地的 `public-chat-web` / `protected-panel-web` + shared `app-api` Worker runtime 基线之上继续完成 `ContextProjection` / `SupervisorResponse` shared seam 对齐与后续 runtime hardening。`Official Web` control-plane foundation 及 panel domain 已落地，`Jobs` / `Operations` 仍不进入第一波 rollout

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (Verification And Release Gate) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 41
- Average duration: mixed agent-run and inline execution; see per-plan summaries
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours + 2026-03-24 inline Phase 2/3 execution

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 9 min | 4.5 min |
| 02 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 03 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 03.1 | 3 | 53 min | 17.7 min |
| 03.2 | 2 | 17 min + inline | mixed |
| 04 | 3 | inline session | n/a |
| 04.1 | 3 | inline session | n/a |
| 04.2 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 04.3 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 04.4 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 04.5 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 04.6 | 3 | inline session | n/a |
| 04.7 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 05 | 3 | inline session | n/a |
| 05.1 | 4 | inline session | n/a |
| 06 | 2 | inline session | n/a |
| 07 | 2 | inline session | n/a |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 05.1-04, 06-01, 06-02, 07-01, 07-02
- Trend: handbook mainline verification evidence is closed; current follow-up work is curriculum release-gate expansion, shared seam closeout, and landed `official_web` surface hardening rather than topology/bootstrap work

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Query-serving is now runtime-profile-driven; current query-enabled scope is `student_handbook` plus `curriculum_plan`, while `campus_services` remains `offline_preparation`.
- Verification remains a dedicated release-gate phase after the main architecture path is in place.
- `official-web` / `availability` specialist landed as an explicit non-RAG specialist boundary instead of a supervisor-inline tool bundle.
- `/api/v1/answer` now constructs a supervisor-facing request contract instead of hardcoding a rag-specialist handoff.
- Phase 03.2 froze the data-plane direction as `raw -> source truth -> declared projections -> document/chunk/index`; later handbook-derived outputs must replay from persisted source truth instead of returning to raw.
- Phase 04 froze `rag-specialist` answer semantics on top of the accepted hybrid retrieval baseline with grounded citations plus `needs_clarification` / `no_answer` / `error` fail-close behavior.
- Phase 04.6 closed the Worker-to-origin seam: `apps/public-entry-worker -> apps/supervisor-api` with trusted-worker origin auth.
- Phase 04.7 is now completed on `main`; `apps/public-consumer-chat` implementation is a historical reference rather than the forward backend topology truth.
- Phase 05 removed bearer actor spoofing, projected caller claims from forwarded Access JWT payload, and moved durable audit persistence to the API shell boundary.
- The accepted forward design is now `public-chat-web` + `protected-panel-web` + shared `app-api`; auth/session/conversation, chat ingress, and operator query move into `app-api`, while `apps/supervisor-api` remains the execution engine.
- `apps/app-api` runtime is now frozen to Worker rather than remaining runtime-agnostic.
- `apps/app-api` is now the only product-layer auth/session/principal owner; `apps/supervisor-api` should be read as internal execution admission plus execution transport, not user-auth ownership.
- Protected panel request visibility is now fixed on shared `apps/app-api`: panel `Requests` must consume the shipped runtime-owned query surface and must not route around it through `apps/supervisor-api`, audit logs, telemetry sinks, or consumer chat tables.
- canonical request projection is now explicitly same-database outbox-first: `runtime.request_execution` plus `runtime.projection_outbox` are the first durable truth, while queues are optional later acceleration only.
- Better Auth is now fixed inside `apps/app-api`, and `auth/chat/runtime/operator` are expected to share one Drizzle schema codebase plus one migration pipeline; Worker runtime DB access remains Hyperdrive-based while migrations use a direct management connection.
- Protected panel operator access is now explicitly documented as a small-team operator surface without a self-serve end-user account system; `Jobs` and `Operations` remain delayed pending re-discussion.
- shared `apps/app-api` Worker foundation, request projection APIs, and current web-surface wiring are now implemented in this worktree; remaining work is follow-up hardening rather than topology bootstrap.
- `official_web` control plane is now implemented on `apps/app-api` with dedicated schema, collector command/query endpoints, outbox-driven operator projections, and scheduled ingestion handoff dispatch; `apps/protected-panel-web` now consumes the owned site/run/detail APIs instead of treating `Official Web` as a blocked next domain.
- Phase 05.1 froze curriculum source-truth quality gates, split-manifest review fail-close behavior, and explicit chunking runtime truth.
- Phase 06 added `provider_response_replay` rebuild support for `curriculum_plan`, and the current refactor promotes its serving policy into the profile-driven query surface.
- Phase 07 closed handbook release-gate verification with repo tests, live qrels benchmark, workflow/status samples, and handbook collection schema evidence under `.tmp/phase7/`.
- The detailed `app-api` implementation baseline now lives in `docs/plans/app-api-worker-foundation.md`, including framework selection, API surface, data domains, and execution waves.
- `app-api` 第一版产品层 HTTP contract、`app-api -> supervisor-api` execution contract、request lifecycle、error model 与 logical schema 现已冻结在 `docs/contracts/` 与 `docs/data/`。
- The accepted long-term split now separates verified identity, profile memory, session memory, and institutional knowledge into distinct truth layers.
- Personalization may influence intent framing, retrieval planning, clarification, and answer wording, but memory does not grant permissions or widen retrieval ACL.
- The current `develop` integration branch now treats `ContextProjection` + `SupervisorResponse` as the merge-ready shared seam; the pending worktree implementation must keep aligning to that seam instead of reintroducing `snapshot`.
- Curriculum gate closeout now has canonical docs/runbook coverage in `docs/reference/curriculum-plan-eval-metrics.md` and `docs/runbooks/curriculum-plan-hybrid-rebuild-checklist.md`; what remains is fresh live evidence, not fixture design.

### Pending Todos

- Generate fresh `curriculum_plan` live release-gate artifacts using the new curriculum runbook and attach the resulting evidence before milestone closeout.
- Keep handbook chunk-truth validation and handbook eval artifacts as reusable regression gates for later retrieval changes.
- Finish app-api shared seam alignment (`snapshot -> ContextProjection`, `SpecialistResponse -> SupervisorResponse`) before promoting this worktree to `develop` / `main`.
- Keep `official_web` command/query/handoff tests and operator projections as reusable regression gates for later collector or ingestion integration changes.
- Decide the next `app-api` hardening scope on top of the landed Worker foundation without reopening topology ownership.
- Keep `Jobs` and `Operations` out of the default panel rollout until product scope explicitly re-opens them.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No current phase-1 mainline blocker remains inside this follow-up branch.
- Cloudflare 04.x boundary/topology/contract/shell docs are complete; follow-up work must consume them as frozen handoffs rather than reopening architecture churn.
- `public-consumer-chat` is merged on `main`; downstream work should treat it as a historical implementation reference rather than a live backend direction.
- panel `Requests` is no longer blocked, but panel work must still avoid reading audit logs, telemetry sinks, consumer chat tables, or `apps/supervisor-api` directly.
- `Official Web` control-plane APIs and panel domain are now landed on `apps/app-api` + `apps/protected-panel-web`; follow-up work must extend this surface rather than reintroducing panel-side synthesis or direct infrastructure reads.
- `Jobs` / `Operations` / `Audit` remain delayed; landed `Official Web` views do not authorize a generic ops console.
